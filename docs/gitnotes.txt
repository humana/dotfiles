o creating a branch

	git branch branchname [hash]
	git checkout branchname
or
	git checkout -b branchname [hash] to automatically branch and checkout

o stashing - pushes modified tracked files and staged changes onto a stack
	git stash
	git stash list
	git stash apply [stash@{2}] - does not re-add to the index
	git stash apply --index - tries to re-add to the index
	git stash drop - when done applying to pop off stack
	git stash branch <testchanges> tries to re-apply stashed changes (auto-merge) and deletes off stash stack if successful
